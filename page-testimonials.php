		"I can't praise John highly enough for the outstanding work he is doing with Coming Soon Pro. 
Not only the plug-in is a must for any new site launch, doing what it says on the tin and then some more; John himself is providing the best support one could imagine, by engaging right in and lending a helping hand, even when this clearly is far beyond his duty.
Kudos!" <!-- via <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-beautiful-coming-soon-pages-in-wordpress-with-seedprod/" rel="nofollow"> wpbeginner.com</a>  -->

		"One of the very hard lessons we learnt in the past is that every business needs a coming soon page before the launch. Coming Soon page is a crucial component of having a successful website/product launch.  In the past creating a coming soon page required coding skills, but now with WordPress and SeedProd plugin, things have gotten a lot easier. So easy that a beginner can do it." <!-- via <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-beautiful-coming-soon-pages-in-wordpress-with-seedprod/" rel="nofollow"> wpbeginner.com</a>  -->

		"SeedProd is a great way of building your email list before your website launches. It’s got great social media integration, is easy to use and very easy to style. The maintenance mode option is useful too if you need to switch your website off for 30 minutes or an hour to fix something on your site."

And for someone like me who is more creative than code it was awesome that I didn’t have to touch a scrap of code (besides inserting Google Analytics). With minimal promotion I have already begun seeing email sign-ups and I’m excited about the advantages this will provide me in launching a successful new website and business. I recommend this plugin for anyone."

		"When you’re developing a WordPress site, it’s easiest if you do it on the server that it will be hosted on. That way, you can ensure that there are no compatibility issues when you finally go live. However, you don’t really want the whole world to see your site under development, so you need to find a plugin or theme that provides a landing page, or “Coming Soon” page.
That’s where Coming Soon Pro comes in. "
